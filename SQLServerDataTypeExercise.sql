
--SQL Server Data Types & Type Casting

--1) Write the SQL SELECT statement that returns the FirstName column of Person.Person casted as the VARCHAR data type.

	select 
	cast(FirstName as varchar)
	from Person.Person

/*2) Write three expressions in a single SELECT statement: one that returns the results of 11 divided by 4. 
The second column should return the result of 11 casted as float divided by 4 casted as 
float. The final column should divide 11.0 by 4.0 (including the decimal point and trailing zero).*/

	select 
	11/4,
	cast(11 as float)/cast(4 as float),
	11.0/4.0

--3) Cast the FirstName column of Person.Person as the VARCHAR(3) data type. What happens? Why?

	select 
	cast(FirstName as varchar(3))
	from Person.Person

/*4) Many of the values in the Size column of the Production.Product table contain numeric values. 
Write a SELECT statement that returns the Size column casted as the integer data type. What is 
the result? Why?*/

	SELECT
	CAST(Size AS INT)
	FROM Production.Product

/*5) Using the same SELECT statement that you developed in problem 4, add the WHERE clause, 
“WHERE ISNUMERIC(Size) = 1”. What is the result of the query now? Why? (Hint: use the MSDN 
articles to find how the ISNUMERIC() function is used).*/

	SELECT
	CAST(Size AS INT)
	FROM Production.Product
	WHERE ISNUMERIC(Size) = 1
